# Overview

My main goal with this is to start learning how to actually make an interactive desktop application from scratch that can be downloaded by anybody from the web. I chose a calculator app for the simplicity of the application in order to focus on the other parts such as 
- How to create a Menu?
- How to create buttons that a user can interact with to perform the calculations?
- How does the user download, install, then actually open and use the application?
- How do I translate my knowledge of other programming languages in order to solve this problem?

These are all questions that at the start of this application I do not understand the answer to but wish to.
